# Alien Invasion

Alien Invasion, a space invaders game taken from 'Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition' by Eric Matthes.

This project is intended for my own self-learning experience. The purpose of this project is to help me learn Python, as well as the Pygame module, and also how to use Git/GitHub. Most of the code in this project is from 'Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition' by Eric Matthes, pages 225 - 302. The code not from 'Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition' is code that I came up with, either from figuring out how to do certain thing or generally just tinkering around with the code to see what I can do with it.

To clarify: This project is for the purpose of my own learning. No copyright issues or other issues are intended.
